# Stacks Pipeline: SStacks


#####Note: SStacks requires output files from both UStacks AND CStacks, so you should put output files from UStacks and CStacks into the same folder before proceeding!





#####Example script for running SStacks as it should be entered into the terminal (11/30/2017):

#!/bin/bash
files="WM1 WM2 WM3 WM4 WM5 WM6 WM7 WM8 WM9 WM10 WM11 WM12 WM13 WM14 WM15 WM16 WM17 WM18 WM19 WM20 WM21 WM22 WM23 WM24"
#
for file in $files
do
sstacks -b 1 -c ./jmahguib/UStacks_outputs/batch_1 -s ./jmahguib/UStacks_outputs/$file -o ./jmahguib/UStacks_outputs -p 15
done

sstacks ###Command to initiate the SStacks program within the Stacks module

-b 1 ###Specifies a "database/batch ID for this catalog" (the default ID is 1; you're going to want to match the ID used here to what you used in CStacks)

-c ./jmahguib/UStacks_outputs/batch_1 ###Tells SStacks to read the CStacks output files

-s ./jmahguib/UStacks_outputs/$file ###Tells SStacks to read the UStacks sample output files

-o ./jmahguib/UStacks_outputs ###This is where you want SStacks to put the output files in

-p 15 ###Option to "enable parallel execution" with a specified number of computational threads
