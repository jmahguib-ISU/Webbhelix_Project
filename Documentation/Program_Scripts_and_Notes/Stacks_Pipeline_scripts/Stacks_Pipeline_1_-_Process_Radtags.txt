# Stacks Pipeline: Process_Radtags


#####Note: Process_Radtags must be run on each group of samples by Index used, from each population/location that samples were taken





#####Example script for running Process Radtags as it should be entered into the terminal (07/26/2017):

process_radtags -p ./jmahguib/Raw_GBS_Data/TrkNbr-1083_I12/ -o ./jmahguib/Stacks_Process_RadTags_outputs/TrkNbr-1083_I12/ -b ./jmahguib/Barcodes/Barcodes_I12.txt -e pstI -E phred33 -r -c -q -D -t 90





#####Breakdown of the components of the above script for running Process_Radtags, with annotations:

process_radtags ###Command to initiate the Process_Radtags program within the Stacks module

-p ./jmahguib/Raw_GBS_Data/TrkNbr-1083_I12/ ###Instructs the program to pair the files within the specified directory

-o ./jmahguib/Stacks_Process_RadTags_outputs/TrkNbr-1083_I12/ ###Tells the program to put output files into the specified directory

-b ./jmahguib/Barcodes/Barcodes_I12.txt ###Specifies a file path to the directory containing the 'Barcodes' file for this particular run of the program; 'Barcodes' files need to be constructed in advance by hand and made available for use by Process_Radtags (in other words, 'Barcodes' file must be uploaded to the Speedy server)

-e pstI ###Specifies the restriction enzyme that was used to generate the data

-E phred33 ###Tells the program how to encode the quality scores, based on how sequencing was carried out ('phred33' [Illumina 1.8+, Sanger, default] or 'phred64' [Illumina 1.3 - 1.5])

-r ###Instructs the program to "rescue barcodes and RAD-Tags"

-c ###Instructs the program to "clean data" and "remove any read with an uncalled base"

-q ###Option to "discard reads with low quality scores"

-D ###Tells the program to "capture discarded reads to a file"

-t 90 ###Specifies to the program to "truncate final read length" to the value given
