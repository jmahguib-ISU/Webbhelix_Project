###No mutation model parameterization was required for SNPs. Polymorphism was assumed to result from a single mutation during the whole population gene tree and that SNPs were biallelic (Cornuet et al., 2014).

(3 divergence scenario)

Scenario 1
[Two populations (1 and 3) with constant effective populations sizes OU and SA have diverged at time t2 from an ancestral population of size OUAa1. 
Thereafter, two populations (1 and 2) with constant effective populations sizes OU and CA have further diverged at time t1 from an ancestral population of size OUAa2.]
